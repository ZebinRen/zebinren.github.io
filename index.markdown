I'm a PhD student at [AtLarge](https://atlarge-research.com/), CompSys Section in the Department of Computer Science, VU, Amsterdam.

My main research areas are in storage, the Linux storage stack and how to eliminate the storage bottleneck in machine learning systems. Currently, I'm working on the following areas:

* Optimizing Linux storage stack for high-performance storage devices
* I/O scheduler
* Identify and eliminate the storage bottleneck in machine learning systems
